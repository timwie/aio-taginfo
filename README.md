A typed async client for the [taginfo] API, a system for finding and aggregating
information about [OpenStreetMap] tags, and making it browsable and searchable.

> OpenStreetMap uses tags to add meaning to geographic objects. There is no fixed
> list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed. Everybody can
> come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects. This makes
> OpenStreetMap enormously flexible, but sometimes also a bit hard to work with.
> 
> Whether you are contributing to OSM or using the OSM data, there are always
> questions like: What tags do people use for feature X? What tags can I use for
> feature Y so that it appears properly on the map? Is the tag Z described on the
> wiki actually in use and where?
> 
> Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the
> database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It also
> gets information about tags from the wiki and from other places. Taginfo tries
> to bring together all information about tags to help you understand how they are
> used and what they mean.

> Taginfo has an API that lets you access the contents of its databases in several
> ways. The API is used internally for the web user interface and can also be used
> by anybody who wants to integrate taginfo data into their websites or
> applications.

This library makes use of [aiohttp] for requests, and [Pydantic] for parsing
and validating the responses.

## Usage
> The API is intended for the use of the OpenStreetMap community. Do not use it
> for other services. If you are not sure, ask on the mailing list (see below).
> 
> Always use a sensible User-agent header with enough information that we can
> contact you if there is a problem.
> 
> The server running the taginfo API does not have unlimited resources. Please use
> the API responsibly. Do not create huge amounts of requests to get the whole
> database or large chunks of it, instead use the [database downloads] provided.
> If you are using the API and you find it is slow, you are probably overusing it.
> 
> If you are using the taginfo API it is recommended that you join the
> [taginfo-dev mailing list]. Updates to the API will be announced there and this
> is also the right place for your questions.

Here is an example of an API request using this library:

```python
# either use a temporary session…
response: Response[KeyOverview] = await aio_taginfo.key_overview(key="amenity")

# …or provide your own
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    response: Response[KeyOverview] = await aio_taginfo.key_overview(key="amenity", session=session)
```

## Endpoints
This library is early in development and most endpoints are still missing.
